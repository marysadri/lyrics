Recently, a familiar darkness welled up from the depths of my being.
At first, I was afraid to face it, but now I find myself at peace.
The deeper I journey inward, the more I realize that as much as I have been oppressed, I have also been an oppressor.
As much as I have complained, others have complained about me.
With this realization, moments of understanding and illumination arise.
At times, my heart feels as expansive as the world itself.
I become simply a personâ€”a human being imbued with consciousness, light, and a voice.
Gratitude fills me, appreciation simply for the gift of being human.
