Everything hurts her.
She does not know she is a hedgehog woman.
She wonders why all things cling to her —
why every word pierces,
why every touch leaves a mark.

She does not see the quills she carries,
born of old fears and tender dreams,
nor that her pain is her armor,
her defense against a world too sharp to hold.

Each part carries a memory,
a desire, a shadow, a light —
and I, the witness,
gather them again
to remember who I truly am.

Only when she learns to unfold,
to trust the open air,
will her spines fall silent,
and her soft heart breathe again.
