My consciousness has long wandered through the dark houses of the city of the mind.
If I wish to heal my daily life,
I must take it by the hand with attention, kindness, and patience,
and lead it toward the bright houses until its habit changes.

If I wish to awaken to the truth within me,
and let the springs of knowledge flow from my heart,
I must also pass beyond the ordinary world,
and teach myself the habit of no longer wandering in the mind at all.

For now, reverence is bliss.
