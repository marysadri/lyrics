My Charter is my body —
the vessel through which I behold the worlds.
Through it I see and hear,
through it I speak and think,
through it I love, imagine, and remember.

I am the One consciousness,
whole and indivisible.
Yet when I descend into this form,
my unity is scattered into many faces of being —
sight and sound, mind and heart,
breath and shadow, dream and flame.

Each part carries a memory,
a desire, a shadow, a light —
and I, the witness,
gather them again
to remember who I truly am.

This Charter is my covenant with the Earth,
the bridge between the unseen and the seen.
Through it, the Infinite touches the finite,
and the Eternal learns its own name.
